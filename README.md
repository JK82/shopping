# shopping
A simple shopping list application using React, Node, Express, Clerk (acount management), Supabase (database), MUI & deployed to Heroku

Visit the deployed app [Here](https://shopping-veri.herokuapp.com/) - you will need to accept some cookies as Clerk is in dev mode for this project <br />
Check your spam folder for sign up email & lastly it is hosted on a free tier of Heroku so may need to be awoken by the first request

## Running the project locally
The project conatins a client and server folder, both aspects of the project run independently

Navigate into client folder & run <br />
``` npm i ``` <br />
``` npm run start``` <br />
Navigate into server folder & run <br />
``` npm i ``` <br />
``` npm run start``` <br />

You will also need to add a ```.env.local```  file to both folders, this contains keys for Clerk & Supabase, you can use your own instance <br/>
however I will send this file to anybody who I want to run the project locally so check your inbox
